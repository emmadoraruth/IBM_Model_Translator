secondly , i wish to support the continuation of our european programme for intra-subsidy loans to small companies but to call for clear improvements in the way that these loans are administered .
small- and mediumscale businesses seem to be the european politicians ' pet child .
let us hope that with everything we do not cuddle small- and medium-scale businesses to death .
even though i am in favour of privatization on principle , we must ensure that the proffered information services are simple and affordable for the smes .

commissioner oreja 's answer to my parliamentary question on 13 june when he said that services are provided from norwich or should be sublet from norwich is wholly unacceptable .
there is a huge gap to the north of london , in essex , bedfordshire and hertfordshire .
intermediaries should be much clearer about the role of european support and all member states should operate a reserve list system to help eligible companies who were not first in the queue .
then i come to the european capital market for rapid-growth firms .
secondly , i wish to support the continuation of our european programme for intra-subsidy loans to small companies but to call for clear improvements in the way that these loans are administered .
definitely not , in my opinion .
the easdaq may perhaps start in september and will finally provide a solution within and not outside europe for the rapid-growth advanced high-technology smes .

how do we solve that ?
with a recommendation or a directive ?
paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution calls for a directive .
the arguments for that are too slight .
the lack of knowledge and expert advice and an incomplete internal organization certainly have something to do with this , but also the lack of a position of power in negotiations serves the smes ill .
if others have to pay on time , he will have to as well .
in another arena that would be called fraud and it is shameful that the uk has the worst record of late payments in europe at a dismal average of 23 days .
the rapporteur 's argument does not hold water .
then i come to the european capital market for rapid-growth firms .

it would also be a good thing if small firms were allowed to deliver their vat return quarterly or were allowed a longer time for returns .
more far-reaching proposals would quickly amount to an encroachment on freedom to contract .
i say in advance that i shall not blame the member states if they say they cannot do much with the commission 's recommendation .
mr president , smes are becoming increasingly important as a means of boosting the economy and reducing the high unemployment figures .
that makes it all the more pleasing that , if the report draws the right conclusions , the grant of interest subsidies has done more than expected to create new jobs in european smes .
even though i am in favour of privatization on principle , we must ensure that the proffered information services are simple and affordable for the smes .

commissioner oreja 's answer to my parliamentary question on 13 june when he said that services are provided from norwich or should be sublet from norwich is wholly unacceptable .
and of course i should like to congratulate mr harrison for his splendid report .
a single solution is impossible .
different solutions will have to be applied .
what is happening is that the report on the recommendation has the great advantage of bringing solutions to a specific subject .
as i said before , the problem of payment periods has no single legal solution and the law cannot be regarded as the only option .
however , terry pearce from precision components remains sceptical about europe 's involvement .
mr president , in supporting today 's proposals in favour of small business i want to bring to this chamber the clear experience of small business in my own constituency .
all these organizations are committed to nurturing small and medium-sized companies .
the question is what can the european union do to help us .
secondly , i wish to support the continuation of our european programme for intra-subsidy loans to small companies but to call for clear improvements in the way that these loans are administered .
yet non-payment of invoices presents a real problem to their manager , david stear .
in the organization for independent employers and smes for which i worked for years it was our slogan that smes are not just pocket-sized big business .
commissioner oreja 's answer to my parliamentary question on 13 june when he said that services are provided from norwich or should be sublet from norwich is wholly unacceptable .
that is why our initiative to end this scourge of late payments is absolutely right .

it would also be a good thing if small firms were allowed to deliver their vat return quarterly or were allowed a longer time for returns .
too many of them have told me of the difficulties associated with this scheme .
just this week thames estuary plastics of rayleigh has had its interest subsidy from europe confirmed to support twelve new jobs as part of a &pound; 470 , 000 project .
intermediaries should be much clearer about the role of european support and all member states should operate a reserve list system to help eligible companies who were not first in the queue .

another company , beaver 84 ltd , of basildon was not even told by its intermediary that its application for a financial lease was even on the list for a european subsidy .

finally , on the european information centres , we receive no service in essex .
there is a huge gap to the north of london , in essex , bedfordshire and hertfordshire .
essex has 66 , 000 overseas and uk businesses providing 590 , 000 jobs .
commissioner oreja 's answer to my parliamentary question on 13 june when he said that services are provided from norwich or should be sublet from norwich is wholly unacceptable .
let the essex county council library service be a european information centre .
no new money is needed .
we simply want the title so that we can get access to the information , to the publications and to the network of other centres .
it is not working at the moment in essex .
in another arena that would be called fraud and it is shameful that the uk has the worst record of late payments in europe at a dismal average of 23 days .
a directive looks very nice for the smes but how will that help an employer ?
since edinburgh it has been the custom for every european council to sing the praises of the small- and medium-scale businesses .
again and again the part they play in economic growth and in the creation of employment is painted in glowing colours - as happened in florence too .
the fundamental political significance of this must naturally not be underestimated , but let us not forget that a policy needs specific action if it is to be of any use .
even though i am in favour of privatization on principle , we must ensure that the proffered information services are simple and affordable for the smes .
in the organization for independent employers and smes for which i worked for years it was our slogan that smes are not just pocket-sized big business .
any rules governing payment periods will moreover have to take into account aspects of tax policy - particularly those relating to smes , banking policy , cross-border transfers , industrial policy , business training and business management techniques .
more far-reaching proposals would quickly amount to an encroachment on freedom to contract .
it would also be a good thing if small firms were allowed to deliver their vat return quarterly or were allowed a longer time for returns .

at that time i was anxious to reduce the target group to undertakings with fewer than 250 employees .
just this week thames estuary plastics of rayleigh has had its interest subsidy from europe confirmed to support twelve new jobs as part of a &pound; 470 , 000 project .
i am glad to note today that that promise has been kept .
i also support the rapporteur , mrs ewing , to the full when she asks for priority attention to those of less than 50 employees .

we shall certainly talk about this again in debating the multiannual programme .
the easdaq may perhaps start in september and will finally provide a solution within and not outside europe for the rapid-growth advanced high-technology smes .
late payments are not infrequently the cause of one or a series of bankruptcies .
they are an evil which smes relatively often have to reckon with .
in the organization for independent employers and smes for which i worked for years it was our slogan that smes are not just pocket-sized big business .
the question is whether we can put this right with a directive .
personally i have doubted this for a long time and have always advocated harmonization of procedural law , the introduction of simple judicial procedures and encouragement of extrajudicial arbitration procedures .
even though i am in favour of privatization on principle , we must ensure that the proffered information services are simple and affordable for the smes .
as a result we have been able to arrive at a report which has the full approval of my group .
